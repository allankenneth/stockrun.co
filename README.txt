Stockrun.co is a very simple way to add stock items to a list (basket), get a subtotal, and be able to email the basket to whomever. This prototype is built in a very manual way, using simple PHP to read a CSV file for the main stock list;it uses localstorage for the basket, and thus depends on javascript. Built with Twitter Bootstrap. I say again: THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. It is insecure and is dangerous to run on a public server without serious modification.
